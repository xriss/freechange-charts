# Freechange is a javascript module and data to perform historical currency exchange.

For documentation on usage, sources and downloads, it is recommended that you visit [Freechange](https://github.com/xriss/freechange).

Otherwise, this repo serves as the front-facing public website for [Freechange](https://github.com/xriss/freechange).  
It gathers data from Freechange and displays historical exchange rates as simple daily, monthly and yearly charts.

We currently have historical exchange rates for 190 currencies with varying degrees of support and resolution.

You can view this list by visiting https://xriss.github.io/freechange-charts/ and selecting from USD to your currency of choice.

The monthly chart represents good coverage so if that is missing then we do not support that currency very well.
